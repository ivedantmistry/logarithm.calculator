# Logarithm Calculator

This is a simple logarithm calculator implemented in Python using the Qt5 library. It provides the functionality to calculate logarithms with different bases and perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Calculate logarithm with base 10 or base e (natural logarithm).
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- GUI interface for ease of use.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/vedantmistryy/logarithm.calculator.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
-Python3
-Qt5 Library

Note: Make sure you have the Qt5 library installed on your system before running the calculator. You can install it using the following command:
```
pip install PyQt5
```

3. Run the calculator:
- If you have Python installed, run the following command:
  ```
  python logarithm.py
  ```

  Note: Make sure you have the Qt5 library available in your Python environment.

- Alternatively, you can directly run the executable file:
  - Copy the `logarithm.exe` file from the repository.
  - Double-click on the `logarithm.exe` file to launch the calculator.

  Note: The executable file may trigger security warnings on some systems. If prompted, click on "Run" or "Allow" to proceed.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to enhance this logarithm calculator by adding more advanced scientific calculator functionalities, including:

- Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
- Exponential functions
- Square root and power functions
- Memory functionality to store and recall values

Stay tuned for updates and improvements!
